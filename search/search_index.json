Our Chinese laser, manufactured by Omtech, features: 80W output 600 \u00d7 900 mm (24\" \u00d7 35\") working surface A Ruida controller Rotary axis attachment Safety and Certification Protective Equipment Safety glasses : Polycarbonate, acrylic, or any prescription glasses will offer protection from IR light. Water spray bottle : to put out small fires. Hazards Laser-cutting presents a risk of fire and burns. Laser-cutting certain materials can release gases that are harmful to humans and may damge the machine. The laser emits invisible infrared radiation that can damage your eyes. The laser is powered by high-voltage, and presents an electrocution risk if the cabinet is open. Prohibited Operations Modifying or hacking the laser cutter and its accessories without board approval. Bypassing interlocks or safety features. Cutting materials that may harm humans or equipment. Prohibited materials The following materials should NEVER be placed into the laser cutter. Material Reason polycarbonate Melts instead of burns, releases poison gas vinyl Melts instead of burns, releases poison gas PVC Melts instead of burns, releases chlorine gas Neoprene Sublimated vapors damage the optics Moleskin notebooks Contains chlorine, releases poison gas ABS Burning ABS releases hydrogen cyanide gas self-laminated or glued Anything you laminated yourself or glued together is a fire hazard low-grade plywood Excessive bowing can cause the gantry to catch on the wood being cut Pre-flight checklist Before every use Make sure that the machine and workspace are clutter-free. The laser cutter is not a table . Have a plan for putting out small fires without causing damage to the machine. A small spray bottle of tap water or rag for smothering is usually fine for this purpose. Verify a fire extinguisher is easily accessible in case things go wrong. Check that the auxiliary systems (chiller, air and exhaust) are properly connected and functional. The Air pump is internal to the machine, and controlled by software. The chiller and exhaust impeller should be plugged directly into the laser cutter, and should turn on when the machine is running. Operation checklist Operational Safety Ensure material to be cut is safe to use. See Consumable Material Reference for details. Never leave a laser cutter unattended when running a job Take care to select appropriate power/speeds settings to avoid combustion. Always start jobs with lowest power if unsure. Basic Operation Checklist Select an appropriate power and speed for the material you are cutting. Here are some good starting guidelines for various materials below. Some materials are highly variable, especially wood. Do some test cuts and engraves to dial in the right settings.

Place the material under the Z-axis sensor, press Fn , and use the up/down arrow to highlight Auto Focus setting, and press Enter to set the Z-height. This will place the focus exactly at the top of the material, and set the machine Z-height to 0. Use this setting for engraving. For cutting, especially thick material, you will need to adjust the Z-height to the center of the material. However since the auto-focus sets the height of the bed to the surface, and won't let you back-drive the bed to Z < 0, you will need to place another piece of material of the same thickness before using the auto-focus, and then back-drive the bed down (3/2) \u00d7 (material thickness). Post-flight checklist End of operation and clean-up Power down the machine Wipe surfaces Clean debris from inside as needed with shop vac.
